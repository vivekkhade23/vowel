1. A Landing page on which the customer sees the products and adds them to the cart.
2. A cart page on which the customer can manage the product quantity.
3. A checkout page where the customer fills up his contact information and address.
4. There should be a payment page where the customer can pay the charge. Use any kind of payment gateway that uses test payment like a sandbox.
Backend:
1. Product management. Admin should be able to create, edit and delete the products.
2. Order management. Customer-placed orders should be displayed.
